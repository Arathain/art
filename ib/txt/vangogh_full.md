Having both been born and died in the late 19th century, Vincent Van Gogh came to be known as one of the most influential painters of all time, his post-impressionist works still inspiring countless artworks to this day. The Dutch painter lived a troubled life, having severe mental health issues and a streak of bad luck when it came to romantic relationships, his main releases from his torment being art, faith, and his brother Theo. His paintings were very often dreamy and not-quite-realistic, more often portraying landscape and still life rather than portraits or characters. Vincent died peacefully in bed in the town of Auvers-su-Oise, having shot himself a day beforehand.

Probably the most 'curly' out of all the artworks, Van Gogh's *Cypresses* has a dreamy quality to itself, and also probably has the second-most highlighted subject, the cypress. Commonly associated with death, it looks rather surprising when made with such lively colours and dancing, swirly look. The entire image blends together, giving it the general aesthetic of a hot, lazy summer afternoon, with the colours of the image being all rather striking and unusually vibrant for Van Gogh.

With most of the artwork being paled in terms of colour, the shapes present in Vincent's *The Old Mill* are what makes it interesting. Most of the lines of action in the image, while rather faint, point towards the house on the right, while the *lack* of shapes on the left eventually focuses you on the two characters present. While the most tame of the three artworks showcased, it nevertheless carries a rustic, cottagecore-y charm to itself, the ramshackle aesthetic of the buildings bringing that nostalgic, idealised village life to mind. The river stream and the hills in the background complement the verticality of the mill, framing the two people on the left in a 3-sided container.

Gogh's *Starry Night Over The Rhone*, like many others that Van Gogh made, is easier to grasp when far away or squinting, but even without it carries a beauty and charm with it. Most of the artwork gravitates towards the middle left of it, eventually straying downwards to the boats and the two figures. The lights reflecting across the lake all bounce beautifully down the piece, guiding the viewer's attention down from the stars in the background to the foreground and its' two denizens. The colour choice in the painting is also distinctly memorable; the yellow and blue, being in direct contrast, give the painting the precise clarity that a starry night needs.
