- Vincent Van Gogh was a troubled Dutch painter, spending most of his life in the Hague, and wandering across the country for several months. He was highly religious but also notoriously unstable at times, being locked up in an asylum for a long while. The</p>
- He had a strong relationship with his brother Theo, and later in his life Theo became his main financial supporter, especially with his father growing tired and impatient of Vincent.
- His works were post-impressionist, filled with swirls of paint and slightly distorted, familiar yet non-lifelike shapes. 
- Their mental health was on the decline, their asylum visit being incited by them cutting their own ear off. Van Gogh committed suicide near the town of Auvers-su-Oise, dying after shooting himself a day before.
- Their works rarely portray faces and characters, rather showing landscape scenes as if through a stained, crudely-cast glass pane.

Probably the most 'curly' out of all the artworks, it has a dreamy quality to itself, and also probably has the second-most highlighted subject, the cypress. Commonly assosciated with death, it looks rather surprising when made with such lively colours and swirly look.

With most of the artwork being paled in terms of colour, the shapes are what makes it interesting. Most of the lines of action in the image, while rather faint, point towards the house on the right, while the *lack* of shapes on the left eventually focus you on the two characters present.

This painting, like many others that Van Gogh made, is easier to grasp when far away or squinting, but even without it carries a beauty and charm with it. Most of the artwork gravitates towards the middle left of it, eventually straying downwards to the boats and the two figures.
