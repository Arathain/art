# What inspires you about the museum?
<p>Some of the artwork presented had legitimate artistic value, and the usage of simple things to convey complex subjects, while very often a dangerous craft, is truly inspiring when it works out.</p>

# What do you not care for about the museum?
<p>Most of the artwork presented was highly reliant on side descriptions to actually deliver its' message, and some of them were entirely obfuscated for me. I also did not get to see much actual craftsmanship, seeing as most of the artpieces were fairly simple in terms of technique.</p>

# What was a highlight of the visit for you?
<p>Probably the food trucks. Barring that, the room under the ground floor, featuring artworks including the turkey, the windows popups, and the monochrome sea & sky.</p>
